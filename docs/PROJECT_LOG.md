Date: July 2026

## Completed

### Authentication

- Integrated Clerk Authentication.
- Added ClerkProvider to Root Layout.

### Dashboard

Created initial dashboard layout consisting of:

- Sidebar
- Topbar
- Dashboard Content Area

Current dashboard sections:

- Mock Interviews
- Resume Score
- DSA Progress
- Achievements

### UI

Created reusable dashboard components.

Current folder structure:

client/
├── app/dashboard
├── components/dashboard
│ ├── Sidebar.tsx
│ ├── Topbar.tsx
│ ├── DashboardContent.tsx
│ └── DashboardCard.tsx

### Status

Authentication is fully functional.

Users can:

- Sign Up
- Verify email
- Sign In
- Access protected dashboard

Dashboard currently displays placeholder statistics.

Next sprint will focus on making the dashboard interactive.

# Sprint 5 — Dashboard Data Architecture

Date: July 2026

## Objective

Replace static placeholder dashboard cards with a typed, data-driven rendering pipeline that's ready to swap mock data for a real backend later with zero component changes.

## Completed

- Created `types/dashboard.ts` — `DashboardStat`, `DashboardActivity`, `DashboardData` interfaces.
- Created `constants/dashboardData.ts` — mock data implementing those types.
- Created `lib/dashboard.ts` — `getDashboardStats()`, the single data-access seam for the dashboard.
- Refactored `DashboardCard.tsx` to accept `label`/`icon name`/`trend` instead of hardcoded `title`/JSX icon.
- Refactored `app/dashboard/page.tsx` into a Server Component that awaits `getDashboardStats()` and renders cards via `.map()`.

## Engineering Concepts Learned

- Data-access layer pattern (seam between UI and data source)
- Server Components fetching data directly with `await`, no `useEffect`
- Icon-name-to-component mapping for JSX-free data files
- Designing types before implementation ("types first")

## Status

Dashboard now renders 4 stat cards from a typed mock data layer. Sidebar links to `/dashboard/interviews`, `/dashboard/resume`, `/dashboard/dsa`, `/dashboard/analytics`, `/dashboard/settings` still 404 — next sprint session will add stub routes and the User Profile page.

---

# Sprint 5 (continued) — Routing & User Profile

## Completed

- Created `ComingSoon` reusable placeholder component.
- Added stub pages for all sidebar routes: `/dashboard/interviews`, `/dashboard/resume`, `/dashboard/dsa`, `/dashboard/analytics`, `/dashboard/settings` — no more 404s from the sidebar.
- Added `/dashboard/profile` using Clerk's `<UserProfile />` for full account management.
- Updated `Sidebar.tsx` to include the Profile link.

## Engineering Concepts Learned

- Parameterized placeholder components to avoid duplicated JSX across stub routes
- When to use a library's built-in UI vs. building your own (security-sensitive surfaces)
- Next.js file-based routing — folder name must exactly match the `href` path

## Status

Sprint 5 complete. Dashboard now has: dynamic data-driven stat cards, a fully working sidebar with no dead links, and a real Profile page. All remaining dashboard sections (Interviews, Resume, DSA, Analytics, Settings) are stubbed and ready for their own dedicated sprints per the roadmap.

# Sprint 6 — Mock Interview Module (Text-Based, MVP)

Date: July 12, 2026

## Strategy Shift

Pivoted to MVP-first development. Priority is a deployed, placement-ready v1.0 
over full feature completeness. Target deploy date: **July 30, 2026**. 
DSA Tracker deferred to v1.1 (post-launch) — will ship as "Coming Soon" 
badge in v1.0 nav.

## Objective

Build a complete, clickable Interview module end-to-end on mock data, 
with AI integration points clearly isolated for later wiring — no voice/webcam, 
text-only per revised MVP scope.

## Completed

- Extended `types/interview.ts` — `InterviewSession`, `InterviewQuestion`, 
  `InterviewType`, `InterviewStatus`, `NewInterviewInput`.
- Built mock question bank in `constants/interviewData.ts` (`generateMockQuestions`).
- Extended `lib/interviews.ts` seam with in-memory session store: 
  `getInterviewSessions`, `getInterviewSession`, `createInterviewSession`, 
  `submitAnswer`, `completeInterview`.
- Built `StartInterviewForm`, `InterviewHistoryCard`, `InterviewsPageClient`.
- Built `InterviewSessionClient` — question-by-question answer flow.
- Built `InterviewResults` — score + per-question feedback view.
- Wired dynamic route `app/dashboard/interviews/[id]/page.tsx`.
- Marked two seam points with `TODO(v1.0-AI)` for real OpenAI integration:
  question generation and answer evaluation/scoring.

## Engineering Concepts Learned

- Dynamic routing (`[id]` segments) in App Router
- Designing a mock seam that mirrors the shape of a future async AI call
- Client-side in-memory store as a bridge before real backend/DB exists
- Marking integration points explicitly (`TODO(v1.0-AI)`) for clean future handoff

## Status

Interview module is functionally complete on mock data: start → answer → 
score → results → history. Next: Resume Analyzer frontend shell (same 
pattern), per revised MVP roadmap.

---

# Sprint 7 — Resume Analyzer (Frontend Shell)

Date: July 2026

## Objective

Build a complete Resume Analyzer UI on mock data, following the same 
Data → Constants → lib (seam) → Components → UI pattern as Interviews, 
with AI/backend integration points isolated for later wiring.

## Completed

- Created `types/resume.ts` — `Resume`, `ResumeAnalysis`, `ResumeSuggestion`.
- Created `constants/resumeData.ts` — mock AI analysis output (summary, 
  ATS score, categorized suggestions).
- Created `lib/resume.ts` — in-memory seam: `getCurrentResume`, `uploadResume` 
  (single current resume, re-upload replaces it — no versioning for MVP).
- Built `ResumeUpload` — drag-and-drop + file picker, PDF-only validation, 
  simulated processing delay.
- Built `ResumeAnalysisView` — ATS score, summary, categorized suggestion cards.
- Built `ResumePageClient` — ties upload + analysis view together.
- Wired `app/dashboard/resume/page.tsx`.
- Marked two integration points: `TODO(v1.0-backend)` (real file storage) 
  and `TODO(v1.0-AI)` (real PDF parsing + AI feedback).

## Verification Pass

Audited existing stub routes before starting new work — confirmed 
`app/dashboard/dsa/page.tsx`, `app/dashboard/analytics/page.tsx`, and 
`app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx` were already correctly wired to the 
`ComingSoon` component from earlier stub work (Sprint 5). No new work 
needed; sidebar links match route folders exactly. Confirms DSA Tracker 
is already in its intended v1.0 "Coming Soon" state per the MVP scope pivot.

## Bugs Found & Fixed (post-integration testing)

1. **Stale TS server** — VS Code's TypeScript language service cached the 
   module graph from before `types/` files existed, throwing false 
   "cannot find module" errors even though files were correctly created. 
   Fixed via "TypeScript: Restart TS Server."
2. **Interview page never wired** — `app/dashboard/interviews/page.tsx` 
   still pointed at the old `ComingSoon` stub instead of the new 
   `InterviewsPageClient`. Overwritten with the correct import.
3. **Next.js 16 async `params` bug** — `app/dashboard/interviews/[id]/page.tsx` 
   destructured `params` synchronously, but Next.js 16 makes dynamic route 
   `params` a `Promise`. This meant `sessionId` was an unresolved Promise 
   object, not a string, so `getInterviewSession()` never found a match and 
   silently redirected back to the interview list before any question 
   appeared. Fixed by making the page `async` and `await`-ing `params`.

## Status

Resume Analyzer is functionally complete on mock data. Interview module 
confirmed fully working end-to-end after bug fixes above (start → answer 
→ score → results → history). Both modules ready for backend wiring.

---

# Sprint 8 — Backend Foundation (In Progress)

Date: July 2026

## Strategy Context

Per the MVP scope pivot (see Roadmap v1.0 section), this sprint builds 
the real backend that Interviews and Resume's mock `lib/` seams will 
swap into. Chose **Supabase** for hosted Postgres and a **separate 
Express server** (not Next.js API routes) to match the original 
architecture plan and resume/portfolio positioning (Express.js + 
PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM as distinct, demonstrable backend skills).

## Completed So Far

- Drafted `server/` scaffold: Express + TypeScript + Prisma, `tsx` for 
  dev hot-reload.
- Designed Prisma schema: `User`, `InterviewSession`, `InterviewQuestion`, 
  `Resume`, `ResumeSuggestion`, and `DsaProblem` (schema defined now for 
  v1.1, even though the feature itself stays "Coming Soon" in v1.0 — 
  costs nothing to model today, avoids a future migration).
- Built `middleware/auth.ts` — verifies Clerk session tokens sent from 
  the Next.js frontend, find-or-creates a local `User` row keyed by 
  Clerk's user ID.
- Built `middleware/errorHandler.ts` — centralized error responses.
- Built full `routes/interviews.ts` — list, get one, create (mock 
  question bank server-side), submit answer, complete + score. Mirrors 
  the exact function shape of the frontend's `lib/interviews.ts` seam.
- Built `src/index.ts` — Express app entry, CORS scoped to the Next.js 
  client origin.

## Open Items / Blocked On

- Supabase project not yet created — need pooled + direct connection 
  strings before running the first Prisma migration.
- Need to confirm `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` is available server-side (should 
  match the client's Clerk key).
- Flagged uncertainty: Clerk JWT payload may not include `email` by 
  default — may need `@clerk/backend`'s `getUser()` call instead of 
  relying on token claims. To be verified once auth is tested live.
- Resume routes (`routes/resume.ts`) not yet built — planned as the 
  next piece once Interviews routes are verified working against a 
  real DB.

## Status

Backend code is written and ready to run, pending Supabase credentials.
